<span class='head2'>Opening Statement</span><br />
<br />
 

<span class='normal'><b>PD:</b>  Welcome and many blessings. We gather today to celebrate the day of Alban Elfed, the Autumnal Equinox.
Light and shadow exist in harmonious balance. The wheel of the year now turns towards colder days and the approaching Winter.  We begin the holding time before the New Year at Samhain.  
At Alban Elfed our ancestors celebrated the end of the first harvest.  They gave thanks for the bounty and fruits of their hard work.  They would feast together as community and share their
plenty together, as a ritual of thanks to the Gods, the land, and each other.  Witch's Thanksgiving grew out of this tradition.
In honor and remembrance of the old ways, we also gather to give thanks to the Gods, thanks for our harvests, and to each other in community.
 </span> <br />
<br />

<span class='head2'>Earth Mother</span><br />
<br />
<span class='normal'><b>PD:</b> We will begin by honoring the Earth Mother. <br />

<br />

Danu, Earth Mother, beloved keeper of the waters of heaven…mysterious Mother, <br />
Both Sun and Moon, keeper of all light and darkness. <br />
Beautiful one, you shift like the currents in a river.<br />
Within your womb and from your sinuous, snake body we are borne to this Earth. <br />
<br />
We your children, arriving naked on your glittering shores, <br />
long still for the watery home within you from which we passed from death to life….<br />
In you…..through you.<br />
 <br />
Danu, generous ever flowing stream of Celestial Grace, keeper of the waters of Heaven 
and creator of all, we call to you tonight. <br />
 <br />
You who have so lovingly brought your children from the brink of darkness, 
who brought her back into light, back to your nurturing and warm embrace; <br />
 <br />
You who have borne all life from your watery depths and have created brilliant 
order from numbing chaos, favor us with your nurturing and transformative 
presence and be with us tonight as we honor you and bear you praise.<br />
 <br />
Hear your children, Oh Mother of all creation, as we offer this to you!<br />
Beloved Mother of all creation, hear your children!<br />
We bring you this offering in reverence and love to honor you this night.<br />     
<br />
<span class='offering'>[grain offering]</span><br />
<br />
DANU - EARTH MOTHER - JOIN US HERE AND ACCEPT OUR OFFERING!<br />
Bíodh sé Amhlaidh!  All: Repeat.<br />

<br />

<span class='head2'>Inspiration</span>  <br />
<br />
 

<span class='normal'><b>PD:</b>  We will now call for the fires of inspiration, so that our words may be spoken in beauty and eloquence.<br />
<br />
Come Daur Da Blao, Come Coir Cetharchair,<br />
       Come summer, come winter,<br />
       Mouths of harps and bags and pipes!" <br />
			 <br />
 You spoke these words oh mighty Eochaid Ollathair, Great Father of All, The Dagda, Father of our shining Lady, 
 Bright Brid.<br />
Though your reputation as a warrior, master of the Mighty Club, bringer of Death and Life, 
is known to many, we remember you today also as the Good God, whose magical harp mesmerizes both friend and foe! <br />
Caressing the strings of your harp, you gently release the Three Strains of the Bard:<br />
The Goiltraigh (GOYL'tree), the Sorrowful Strain, which causes all who hear to weep.<br />
The Geantraigh (GEON'tree), the Joyful Strain, which causes all who hear to laugh.<br />
The Suantraigh (SWON'tree), the Sleep Strain, which causes all who hear to sleep.  <br />
An Dagda, you spark the fire within us that creates all things.<br />
When the Goiltraigh strain plays, we are comforted in the dark, consuming sadness. 
When the Geantraigh strain plays, we connect with each other and celebrate together. 
When the Suantraigh strain plays, we transit to another time and place.<br />
Without the spark you bring to us, we are on the Death-receiving end of your club,   
Void of comfort, connection or transcendence.<br />
<br />
An Dagda, may your Life-giving, harp-playing, jovial self inspire us tonight, and always. 
An Dagda, I offer to you this whiskey and food so you may do what you do best, 
drink and feast heartily!<br />
<br />
 <span class='offering'>[Offer food and whiskey to fire]</span><br />
 <br />
An Dagda, accept our offering and join us in our rite!    (repeat)<br />
Imbas upon us!  (repeat)<br />
