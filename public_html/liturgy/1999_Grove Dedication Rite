to common awareness and ease of access to the centered state.

and power, your guiding and guarding we say...
<br>Go raibh maith [agat]!
<p>All: We thank you!
<p>Druid makes the closing sign over the hallows with the wand, saying:
<br>Now by the keeper of gates and by our magic we end what we began.
<br>Now let the fire be flame
<br>Let the well be water;
<br>Let all be as it was before.
<br>Let the gates be closed!
<p>All: Let the gates be closed!
