any hearth culture. The ritual for Pagan Pride will be Norse. People should
feel free to make these words their own. If you prefer a different phrasing,
let inspiration take you. Simply try to keep your words at the same length as
the phrases here. We only have 30 minutes for this ritual;&gt;)</span></i><span
