Processional</span></b> <span class='c3'>(Sunwise)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><i><span class='c1'>Participants are lead
by druids (one caring a basket with the coloured eggs, a satchel of
sunflower seeds, a vessel with scotch, and greens) and they circle
the ritual site three times sunwise to music and then settle.&nbsp;
The basket is placed before the altar in front of a large pile of
potting soil.&nbsp; Participants enter the Hallows, sunwise. The
chant, <b>"<u>We Approach the</u></b> <u><b>Sacred Grove</b></u>"
is sung at this point.</span></i><span class='c3'></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><span class='c3'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "May we pray with a good
fire.&nbsp; As our ancestors did and our children may do in times
to come, let us honor the Mighty Ones in the old ways.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><span class='c3'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><span class='c3'>Today we celebrate the
Vernal or Spring Equinox, known in Ireland as <u>Me&aacute;n
Earraigh</u> and in Wales as <u>Alban Eilir</u> - both mean in
their respective languages "Middle-Spring".&nbsp; It is the
festival of the greening on the earth, when the hours of night and
day stand in equilibrium.&nbsp; Let us look with in to discover the
balance that lies within us all.&nbsp; Spring is also a time of
youth and fertility, when the land around us reawakens and new life
begins to burst out and show signs of great promise for the future.
As life on Earth peeps out after a long winter hibernation and
plant life flourishes, so too may we thrive and prosper in all that
we do."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c16"><span class='c3'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span class='c3'>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i> <span class='c3'>&nbsp;"Little
is known about the worship of the Teutonic spring goddess, Ostara,
or by her Saxon name, &Ouml;stre. Famous 8th century historian, the
Venerable Bede, wrote that Eostremonath, now the month of April,
was named for a goddess whose feast day was held on the full moon
following the vernal equinox. He also wrote that her following had
died out by the time he compiled his writings. But died out they
had not!...for Jacob Grimm later writes of her in his 1835
manuscript, Deutsche Mythologie, which was based on surviving oral
traditions. And because here we stand today, remembering her,
honoring her, sharing our feast with her on this equinox of the
21st century!</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c3'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span class='c3'>Other than that she existed -
what else do we know about &Ouml;stre? Both from oral tradition and
from etymological evidence we know that she is goddess of the East,
and therefore of the Rising Sun. We know she is a goddess of
Spring, and therefore goddess of the boons of this season:
pollination, conception, fertility. She is the goddess of the
Equinox, a time of balance and growth when the lean months give way
to abundance. We know the folklore of her companion, The Easter
Bunny, whose following is certainly alive and well - they spent
over 14 billion dollars last year in celebration of the
season!&nbsp;</span></p>

iridescent twinkling of her gown which is the morning dew. The
flowers bloom around her with each footstep. The breeze becomes
honey-sweet as she approaches and the chill of the air recedes. She
is nearing you now and at last her color is becoming clear. Her
shimmering hair, her welcoming smile. The lusty fertility of a
youth, with the wise and knowing eyes of a mother. See her clearly
now, in whatever form and color she shows you. Remember

is real! That she is powerful! She has transcended multiple

faster than a rabbit's brood in Spring! "</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><span class='c3'>"In this Month of
Greening, youth abounds and can be found all around us. Baby chicks
and ducklings, new lambs, calves, and fawns have long been
associated with this time year.&nbsp; One Youth stands out amongst
our Lore as a symbol of the great promise of the future.&nbsp; The
story is a long one, as all good one are.&nbsp; So I'll be brief.
While Finn Mac Cumhal, leader of the mighty Fianna, was away doing
battle with the enemy, his pregnant wife Sadbh (who he met under
Otherworldly circumstances...chasing a gorgeous doe while hunting)
was lured out of the keep by a stranger who was disguised as Finn
and she was magically transformed back into a doe and was taken
away.&nbsp; His people searched everywhere but they could not find
her and on his return Finn became consumed with the search for his
love."</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><span class='c3'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal c4"><span class='c3'>"After seven years of end
searching, Finn's hunting party came upon a wild and beautiful
young boy.&nbsp; They adopted the young lad and gave him the name
Ois&iacute;n.&nbsp; They fed him, cleaned him up, and before long
the child lost his wildness and became one of them.&nbsp; Finn soon
began to recognize the likeness of his wife in the boy and when the
Ois&iacute;n learned to talk told everyone his story.&nbsp; He was
born a fawn and raised by a beautiful doe trapped in a
cliff-wrapped valley.&nbsp; A dark stranger would visit every now
and then and try to talk with the doe, but the doe would run away
with scorn in her eyes.&nbsp; This happened again and again, until
one day the stranger became furious and struck the doe with a hazel
wand and forced her to follow him, leaving Ois&iacute;n
behind.&nbsp; Ois&iacute;n, distraught and overwhelmed over losing
his mother, fell to the ground sobbing and soon fell asleep.&nbsp;
When he awoke was surrounded by Finn's hunting hounds, he was now a
human boy and the rest of the story they all knew.&nbsp;
Ois&iacute;n was recognized as Finn's son and continued to live and
fight among the Fianna, eventually becoming a great warrior and
their chief bard and poet."</span></p>
