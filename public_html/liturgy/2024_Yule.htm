<p><strong>IMBOLC 2005 LITURGY</strong><b><br>
</b>Raven's Cry Grove, ADF<br>
Composed by Todd Covert, RCG Liturgist &amp; Sr. Druid Emertis &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Additional text by Eva Gordon<br>
<br>
<strong>HALLOWS OF THE NEMETON: </strong><em>Cauldron filled with water (some
from the members homes) Fire altar, to be lit from a candle brought from the
PD's home, and Bile (sacred tree).</em><i><br>
<br>
<em>PD leads a brief introduction and orientation to the rite of Imbolc. Light
the source fire.</em><br>
<em>Three torch fires for Brigid are lit preceding the Call to the Rite.&nbsp;</em><br>
</i><br>
<strong>Call to the Rite</strong><br>
<em>Thrice-three chimes announce the rite.</em><br>
<br>
<strong>Protecting the Hallows (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;We will now seek to protect our rite from the powers that may wish to
hinder us.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>A Druid lights a flame in the South and speaks:</em><br>
&quot;Ancient and Dark Ones of the deep and the wild,<br>
You who held this place of old and would hold it once again,<br>
I light this flame against your return,<br>
But invite you to take of it what warmth you will.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>An offering of grain (or other food) is made to the South of the Hallows.</em><br>
<br>
&quot;Accept this offering and trouble not our rite, Nor hinder the forces of
prosperity in this time.&quot;<br>
&quot;Bitheadh e mar sin.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (BEE-uh ay mar SHIN)<br>
<br>
All: &quot; Bitheadh e mar sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>First torchbearer (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) prepares to
lead the procession into the nemeton.</em><i><br>
<em>Two other torchbearers (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) and
(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) stand to either side of the
entrance to the nemeton.&nbsp;</em></i><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Tapadh leibh; thank you.&nbsp; As our Ancestors did in times before
and our children may do in times to come,<br>
let us honor the Gods in the Old Ways.&nbsp; Brothers and sisters, let us pass
between the flames of Brigid and join in worship!&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>[ Drumming begins... ]</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Brideog Procession</strong><br>
<br>
<em>First torchbearer (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) leads&nbsp;
the procession and stands by the unlit main fire.&nbsp; Women enter the nemeton
first, with the brideog doll.&nbsp; When the Brideog is placed in her basket
and all women have entered, PD announces:</em><br>
<br>
PD:&nbsp; &quot;Tha Brighid air tighinn. Brighid is come. Tha fàilte air
Brighid.&nbsp; Brighid is welcome.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>The men respond:</em><br>
&quot;We would enter to honor Brighid.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>All women:</em> &quot;'S e do bheatha! 'S e do bheatha! 'S e do bheatha, a
Bhrìghid!&quot;<br>
(SHAY do VAY-huh SHAY do VAY-huh SHAY do VAY-huh&nbsp; a VREEJ!)<br>
<br>
&quot;Welcome!&nbsp; Welcome!&nbsp; Welcome, O Brighid!&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>The men enter the nemeton. When all attendees have passed between them, the
two other torchbearers (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) </em><i><br>
<em>and (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) join the first and light
the fire. When participants are settled and the altar fire is lit, PD gives an </em><br>
<em>introduction to the rite honoring Brighid.</em></i><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Invocation of the Awen</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Let us now join together in calling on the Awen, spirit of divine
inspiration, that our words and our rite may be fit for the gods and goddesses.<br>
<br>
<em>Call and response, led by EVA: &quot;Light the Fires Within&quot;</em><br>
<br>
LIGHT THE FIRES WITHIN<br>
<em>Taken from &quot;Untitled (Brigid Invocation)&quot; by Jennifer Micale,
member of Grove of the Other Gods, ADF</em><br>
<br>
Eva: Light the fires within, Brigid,<br>
Light the fires within.<br>
<br>
(CHORUS)<br>
ALL: Stoke the ashless blaze within our hearts.<br>
<br>
Eva: You are the fire of the mind.<br>
<br>
ALL: Stoke the ashless blaze within our hearts.<br>
<br>
Eva: You are the dance that moves our feet.<br>
<br>
ALL: Stoke the ashless blaze within our hearts.<br>
<br>
Eva: You are the song within our soul.<br>
<br>
ALL: Stoke the ashless blaze within our hearts.<br>
<br>
Eva: Light the fires within, Brigid,<br>
Light the fires within.<br>
<br>
* ALL: Stoke the ashless blaze within our hearts.<br>
<br>
<em>ALL join in REPEATING the last verse and chorus, until PD brings to a
close.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Sanctifying the Participants</strong><br>
<em>(simultaneously with the Call for Peace).</em><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Let us make ourselves ready for the working of the rite.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>Druids (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) cense and asperge as PD or Other plays harp (Invocation
of Brighid)</em><br>
<br>
<strong>The Call For Peace</strong><br>
<em>PD makes the Call For Peace.</em><br>
<br>
To the East: &quot;May there be peace in the East, ancient Leinster, source of
Prosperity.&quot;<br>
<br>
To the South: &quot;May there be peace in the South, ancient Munster, source of
Harmony.&quot;<br>
<br>
To the West: &quot;May there be peace in the West, ancient Connacht, source of
Wisdom.&quot;<br>
<br>
To the North: &quot;May there be peace in the North, ancient Ulster, source of
Strength.&quot;<br>
<br>
In the Center: &quot;Here in the Center, let peace rule over this rite.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>PD offers grain to the Earth:</em><br>
&quot;May we be united with you, Lady of the Land,<br>
Sovereign of the Realm under Sídhe,<br>
Teach us the mysteries and the lessons of the Land,<br>
A' Chailleach, as our ways find favor in your eyes.<br>
Bitheadh e mar sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
ALL: &quot;Bitheadh e mar sin.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Consecration of the Hallows</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Let us sanctify the Hallows by which we make offering.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>The PD and&nbsp; (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)&nbsp; lead the
folk in beginning the chant:</em><br>
<br>
&quot;Well and Fire and Sacred Tree, flow and flame and grow in me…&quot; <br>
<br>
THE WELL (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;)<br>
<br>
&quot;Sacred Waters, wellspring of life<br>
Goddess Danu, we honor you.&quot;<br>

<strong>Opening the Gates to the Otherworlds</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;We now call on Manannan Mac Lir, our Lord of the Gates to the
Otherworlds, to make open the portals for our worship.&quot;<br>
<br>
D1: ( &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; )<br>
&quot;A Mhanannain Mhic Lir, Gatekeeper, Sidhe King,<br>
Shrouded in mist or met at the crossroads,<br>

<br>
All: &quot;Shining Ones, accept our sacrifice!&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Praise Offerings</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Let any who would offer praise to Brigid or the Three Kindreds come

<em>(Song: Curach Brìghde)</em><i><br>
<em>Time is allowed for all who so wish to make praise offerings.</em></i><br>
<br>
<strong>Main Offering</strong><br>
<em>PD gives an introduction to the Main Offering.</em><br>
PD: &quot;At this time, let us all join in our main offering to Brigid.&quot;<br>

<br>
<br>
<strong>Taking of the Omen</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;)<br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Having made offering to the Gods, let us see how our offering was
received.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>SAC consults ogham and announces the results of the omen-taking. If the
omen is inauspicious, further offerings may be made and a second omen taken. If
the omen is again unfavorable, the rite should be ended, with due thanks made
to the Kindreds. If the omen is auspicious, the rite proceeds.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Candle Lighting</strong><br>
<br>
<em>An opportunity is given for those who have candles they wish to light from
the sacred Fire.</em><i><br>
<em>Distribution of ribbons to hang outside overnight for Brighid's blessing</em><br>
<em>PD, (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) and (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) lead a chant:</em></i><br>
<br>
&quot;Rise up oh flame<br>
By thy light glowing<br>
Bring to us beauty, wisdom and joy.&quot;<br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Seeking the Blessings of the Deities</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;In our custom, a gift calls for a gift. Having offered to the Shining
Ones, we seek their blessings in return.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>D1(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;) pours ale (or the like) into
a cup and holds it up.</em><br>
<br>
&quot;Shining Ones, we seek the blessings of the three Cauldrons,<br>
Of Wisdom, of Plenty, and of Rebirth.<br>
We would share in your magic.<br>
And so we say as one folk: Shining Ones, give us the Waters!&quot;<br>
<br>
All: &quot;Shining Ones, give us the Waters!&quot;<br>
<br>
D2 (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;): &quot;We would stand in
fellowship with you<br>
And feast at your side and proclaim ourselves your People.<br>
And so we say again: Shining Ones, give us the Waters!&quot;<br>
<br>
All: &quot;Shining Ones, give us the Waters!&quot;<br>
<br>
D3 (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;): We have offered of our love and
our work to you;<br>
We have shared our hearthside,<br>
And, as a gift calls for a gift,<br>
We say one last time: Shining Ones, give us the Waters of Life!&quot;<br>
<br>
All: &quot;Shining Ones, give us the Waters of Life!<br>
<br>
<em>D1-3 elevate the cup saying:</em><br>
&quot;Is iad seo Uisgeathan na Beatha! (ISS EE-yud SHO USH-kyun na BAY-huh!)<br>
These are the Waters of Life!&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>The cup is passed among the participants.</em><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;As you share in the blessings of the Mighty Kindreds, do not hesitate
to salute or otherwise honor them. At this time, the Gates are still open and
offerings may yet be made.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>When all have had a chance to drink from the cup and make any offerings,
the rite proceeds.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Thanking the Kindreds</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Let us now give thanks to the Powers we have honored here.&quot;<br>
<em>(The same Druids who invited and/or offered to each Kindred thank them
here:)</em><br>
<br>
D(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;): &quot;Brigid, whose feast this
is, tapadh leat (TAH-pa&nbsp; lyat). We thank you.&quot;<br>
All: &quot;We thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
D(&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;): &quot;A Dheithe! Deities! Tapadh
leibh (TAH-pa leev). We thank you.&quot;<br>
All: &quot;We thank you.&quot;<br>

Tapadh leibh (TAH-pa leev). We thank you.&quot;<br>
All: &quot;We thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
PD: &quot;To all those Powers that have aided our rite, we say once more:
tapadh leibh uile (TAH-pa leev oo-luh) . <br>
We thank you all.&quot;<br>
All: &quot;We thank you.&quot;<br>
<br>
PD: &quot;We return to the Earth those blessings we have left unused.&quot;<br>
<em>SAC makes libation from the blessing cup.</em><br>
<br>
<br>
<strong>Closing the Gates</strong><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;We call once more on Manannan Mac Lir to close the gates.&quot;<br>
<br>
D1 (&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;): &quot;A Mhanannain! Gatekeeper
and Sidhe King!<br>
We thank you for guiding our prayers to the Otherworlds.<br>
We thank you for guiding and warding our steps in all the Worlds.<br>
Let the Fire now be but flame.<br>
Let the Well now be but water.<br>
And let the Tree now be no more than the true heart we carry forth from this
place.<br>
A Mhanannàin Mhic Lìr, dùin na Geataichean an-dràsta! <br>
(Uh VA-na-Nayn Vic LEER, DOO'in na GAY-ti-Chun un DRAW-stuh!)<br>
Let the Gates now be closed!&quot;<br>
<br>
PD: &quot;As we started, so let us end.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>Thrice-three chimes are sounded.</em><br>
<br>
PD: &quot;Brothers and sisters, go in peace and blessings. The rite is
ended.&quot;<br>
<br>
<em>The Participants may process forth from the Hallows as deemed appropriate.</em><i><br>
<em>Feasting ensues...</em></i></p>
